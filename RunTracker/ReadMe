= Project: {RunTracker}

USes a laser diode and a photoresistor to detect when you pass the gate. Useful for timing 40 yard dashes!
Note: Compatible with Arduino UNO Rev3 and must be used with a laser pointer/diode

== Step 1: Installation

1. Open the code in the repository
2. Edit as you like! (Remote adress for inputs)
3. Enjoy!

== Step 2: Assemble the circuit

Assemble the circuit following the diagram schematics.fzz attached to the sketch

== Step 3: Load the code

Upload the code contained in this sketch on to your arduino UNO Rev3
